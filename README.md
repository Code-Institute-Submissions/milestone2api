## First build and commit
I created an HTML and a CSS file. The HTML files contains three sample entries from the dictionary. They are formatted in an accordian taken from Bootstrap. This makes it easier to navigate.

In the first entry, √Åbhacht, I inserted some Javascript code to allow me to conceptualise how to display the standardised versions of the spelling could be. I must find a way to switch back and forth so that users can see the original and the standardised spelling.

## Testing

I checked the formatting of the HTML and the CSS files on validators. This allowed me to improve and correct the code for both files.
